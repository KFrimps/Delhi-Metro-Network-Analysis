<h1>Delhi Metro Network Analysis</h1>




<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the Delhi Metro Network. The primary goal is to provide insights into the network's expansion, the distribution of stations, and other key metrics. Using Python libraries like pandas, folium, and plotly, we explore various aspects of the metro network through interactive visualizations.
<br />

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Data Import and Cleaning</h3>
- <b>Data Import:</b> Load the dataset from a CSV file.<br />
- <b>Missing Values and Data Types:</b> Check for missing values and examine data types for proper formatting.<br />
- <b>Date Conversion:</b> Convert the 'Opening Date' column to a datetime format for time-based analysis.


<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
- <b>Unique Metro Lines:</b> Identify unique metro lines and their corresponding colors for visual differentiation.<br />
- <b>Missing Values and Data Types Summary:</b> Display the count of missing values and data types of each column.
  
<h3>Visualization</h3>
<b>1. Interactive Metro Map:</b> <br />
  > - Create an interactive map using folium to visualize metro stations.<br />
  > - Color-coded markers represent different metro lines, with tooltips showing station names and line 
    names.
  <br />
<b>2. Stations Opened Each Year:</b> <br />
  >- Use plotly to create a bar plot showing the number of stations opened each year.<br />
<b>3. Line Analysis:</b> <br />
>- Calculate the number of stations per line.<br />
>- Determine the average distance between stations for each line.<br />
>- Visualize the number of stations and the average distance between stations for each metro line using subplots.<br />
<b>4. Station Layout Distribution:</b> <br />
>-Analyze and visualize the distribution of different station layouts using a bar plot.<br />
  

<h2>Libraries Used </h2>

- <b>Pandas</b>
- <b>Folium</b>
- <b>Plotly</b>
